        **Budget Mechanics:**
        The weights represent a **pre-planned allocation** across the entire 12-month period:
        - **Total Budget:** ${budget:,.2f}
        - **Weight Sum (Full Window):** {weights.sum():.6f} (should be ~1.0)
        - **Weights Used So Far:** {weights.iloc[:current_day+1].sum():.6f}
        - **Expected Spend to Date:** ${budget * weights.iloc[:current_day+1].sum():,.2f}
        - **Actual Spend to Date:** ${actual_spend:,.2f}
        - **Remaining Weights:** {weights.iloc[current_day+1:].sum():.6f}
        - **Remaining Budget:** ${remaining:,.2f}
        
        **Key Insight:** Each day's allocation (weight √ó total_budget) is independent and pre-determined.
        This is NOT a "remaining budget" model where you split what's left. Instead, it's a strategic
        allocation plan where you commit specific amounts to each day based on expected market conditions.
